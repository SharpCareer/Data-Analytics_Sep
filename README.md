# Project DA116 - Career and Job Recommendation System

## Overview
Project DA116 is focused on developing a machine learning-powered recommendation system for career and job suggestions tailored to individual preferences and skills. The project follows a structured approach from survey data collection, data preprocessing, model building, and finally, API development to deliver personalized recommendations.

## Key Components

### 1. Survey Design & Data Collection
A survey is distributed to college students to gather information regarding their skills, job preferences, and domain interests. The collected data serves as the foundation for model training.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The raw survey data is cleaned and processed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and create meaningful features. The processed data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 3. Model Building
A machine learning model is developed to generate job and career recommendations using techniques such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated for performance based on key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 4. API Development
A RESTful API is developed using Flask or Django to provide users with personalized recommendations. The API is designed to be secure, scalable, and user-friendly, offering endpoints for inputting user profiles and receiving recommendations.
